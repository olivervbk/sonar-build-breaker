## Download and Installation

1. Download the latest release available on this github fork

4. Restart SonarQube

## Description

This plugin will mark the build failed if the project fails its quality gate or uses a forbidden configuration.  These
checks happen after analysis has been submitted to the server, so it does not prevent a new analysis from showing up in
SonarQube.

Upon uploading the analysis information, the plugin follows the below workflow to check the quality gate:

1. Search `${sonar.working.directory}/report-task.txt` for `ceTaskId`, the server-side Compute Engine (CE) task associated with the current analysis
2. Call the `${sonar.host.url}/api/ce/task?id=${ceTaskId}` web service to retrieve `analysisId`
  1. If the CE Task Status is `PENDING` or `IN_PROGRESS`, wait `sonar.buildbreaker.queryInterval` and repeat step 2
  2. If the CE Task Status is `SUCCESS`, save the `analysisId` and proceed to step 3
  3. If the CE Task Status is `FAILED` or none of the above, break the build
  4. If step 2 has been attempted `sonar.buildbreaker.queryMaxAttempts` times, break the build
3. Call the `${sonar.host.url}/api/qualitygates/project_status?analysisId=${analysisId}` web service to check the status of the quality gate
  1. If the quality gate status is `OK`, allow the build to pass
  2. If the quality gate status is `WARN`, allow the build to pass and log the current warnings
  3. If the quality gate status is `ERROR`, break the build and log the current warnings and errors

The build "break" is accomplished by throwing an exception, making the analysis return with a non-zero status code.
This allows you to benefit from the notifications built into CI engines or use your own custom notifications that check the
exit status.

## Usage

### Quality Gate Build Breaker

1. Associate a quality gate to your project
2. Optional: Tune `sonar.buildbreaker.queryMaxAttempts` and/or `sonar.buildbreaker.queryInterval`
  1. Check the duration of previous CE (background) tasks for your project, from submission until completion
  2. Ensure `sonar.buildbreaker.queryMaxAttempts * sonar.buildbreaker.queryInterval` is longer than the above duration (with default values, total wait time is ~5 minutes)
  3. For small projects, a faster interval may be desired so your build times are not longer than necessary
  4. For very large projects or servers with a busy CE queue, more attempts or a longer interval may be necessary
3. Run an analysis on your project
4. If analysis fails while waiting for CE to complete, increase either `sonar.buildbreaker.queryMaxAttempts`, `sonar.buildbreaker.queryInterval`, or both
5. Optional: You may want to choose to enable `sonar.buildbreaker.dryRun` so the BuildBreaker is executed but does not break the build. This is useful when using a third-party tool to read the logs and automate actions, for example Jenkins' Log Parse Plugin (https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Console+Parser+Plugin).


### Forbidden Configuration Build Breaker

Define the property `sonar.buildbreaker.forbiddenConf` with comma-separated `key=value` configurations that will break
the build.

For example, if you set the property to `sonar.gallio.mode=skip`, each analysis on .NET projects executed with
Gallio skipped will be marked "broken".

### Configuration Parameters

| Property | Description | Default value | Example |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------- | ------- |
| `sonar.buildbreaker.skip` | If set to true, the quality gate is not checked.  By default the build will break if the project does not pass the quality gate. | `false` | |
| `sonar.buildbreaker.queryMaxAttempts` | The maximum number of queries to the API when waiting for report processing.  The build will break if this is reached.  Total wait time is `sonar.buildbreaker.queryMaxAttempts * sonar.buildbreaker.queryInterval`. | `30` | |
| `sonar.buildbreaker.queryInterval` | The interval (ms) between queries to the API when waiting for report processing.  Total wait time is `sonar.buildbreaker.queryMaxAttempts * sonar.buildbreaker.queryInterval`. | `10000` | |
| `sonar.buildbreaker.forbiddenConf` | Comma-separated list of `key=value` pairs that should break the build. | | `sonar.gallio.mode=skip` |
| `sonar.buildbreaker.dryRun` | If set to true, the quality gate will be checked for alert or error but the build will not be broken. Useful for checking in the log if the build has reached a threshold. | `false` | | 
| `sonar.buildbreaker.errorThresholdLogStamp` | String to be logged when an ERROR threshold is reached. | `BUILD_BREAKER_ERROR_THRESHOLD` | | 
| `sonar.buildbreaker.warnThresholdLogStamp` | String to be logged when a WARN threshold is reached. | `BUILD_BREAKER_WARN_THRESHOLD` | |
